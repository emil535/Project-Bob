/*     ref.  https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/0/18/static-properties-and-methods
    Swift lets you create properties and methods that belong to a type, rather than to instances of a type. This is helpful for organizing your data meaningfully by storing shared data.
    Swift calls these shared properties "static properties", and you create one just by using the static keyword. Once that's done, you access the property by using the full name of the type.
